array size can't be increased...
linked list do not have size issue...
random element can be acceesed in array but it can't be accessed in the linked list.
we can move right to left or l to r in array but not in linked list.
in array first we have to create space to insert element but in linked list we can directly insert 
insert and delete is easy in array but it is tough in linked list..
  

stack :it is abstarct data type(insert delete in specific order but not in random order)..

sed when we want diffrent data types in different portions
template <typename t>
classname<int> p1;
clasname<int,double,...>object name;
classname<classname<int,int>,int) objeect name;


inbuilt stack:
h. file does not include main
#include<stack>
stack<int >p1;
return type of top is void.
name : empty



QUEUE:
IT IS ALSO AN ABSTRACT DATA TYPE LIKE STACK.
IT FOLlOWS FIFO SYSTEM.
FOR INBUILT:
#INCLUDE<QUEUE>
queue.push
size()
void pop()
bool empty();'


TREES:
ROOT
CHILD
A NODE WITH NO CHILD IS CALLED LEAF NODE.
VECTOR IS A TEMPLATE 
vector<int> v;
//vector<int> *p=new vector<int>();
v.push_back(10);
v.size():	eturns the size of the vector
v.at(4)=>v[4]
v.pop_back():delete the last elemet

class treenode
{
	int data;
	vector<treenode*> children;
